I suggest to do this in managable chunks, for example you can download them per page. It helps if your rules start with a descriptive prefix, like 'AE' for adverse event rules, or 'DEM' for rules on the demography page.\r\n- transform the rules Excel sheet into an Excel test script by running the utility extract_rules.py, like so: \r\n```python extract_rules.py path/to/rules.xls /path/to/test_script.xls```\r\n- enter the test values in the Excel script (see below)\r\n- copy the test script(s) to the folder \"test_scripts\"\r\n- run the validation. like so:\r\n```python validate_rules.py``` \r\n(see below)\r\n- find the results in the output folder as specified in settings.py\r\n\r\nTODO: add instructions for Excel test script\r\nTODO: add instructions for selecting which test files to run\r\nTODO: add instructions for crontab\r\n","google":"UA-59041279-1","note":"Don't delete this file!
